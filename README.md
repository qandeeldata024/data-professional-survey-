# data-professional-survey-
this is a data analysis project on data professionals survey dataset  
I started my project by removing Empty records , Delete useless columns and inconsistent data using power query editor 
I made two cards to show the avg age of survey appllicants and the number of appllicants 
I used stacked bar chart to show the higher salary in data jobs which show the data science is by far the higher salary job in our data 
I used stacked coulmn chart to show the most used programming language in data fields stacked by job title and It shows that python is the most used PL in data field by far 
I made gauge chart to how satssified the survey appllicants with there sallaries and with Work - life balance 
and it shows satssifaction rate was low with salary and above the middle with work - life balance  
i made tree map chart by country to make ability to use the data
